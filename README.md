# Drug Recommendation System Using Pharmacogenomics

## Overview
This project develops an AI-driven drug recommendation system leveraging pharmacogenomics data to provide personalized medication suggestions. It aims to optimize drug efficacy and minimize adverse reactions by analyzing individual genetic profiles.

## Problem Statement
Traditional drug prescriptions often use a “one-size-fits-all” approach, ignoring genetic differences that affect drug response. Pharmacogenomics studies these variations, enabling personalized medicine. This system uses machine learning models to recommend drugs based on patients’ genomic data.

## Dataset
- Source: PharmGKB
- Size: 3570
- Features: Genetic markers (SNPs), patient demographics, drug response labels

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing: Genetic data encoding, normalization
- Feature selection: PCA
- Model used: Random Forest
- Training: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Results
- Model performance summary
- Confusion matrix or other relevant visualizations
- Interpretation of results and limitations

## Demo

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies (`requirements.txt`)  
3. Prepare dataset as per instructions  
4. Run training and inference scripts  

## Future Work
- Incorporate more genomic features  
- Collaborate with medical experts for validation
